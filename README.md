# CNN_COVID19_detection
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using the EfficientNetB1 pre-trained model.

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. This project leverages deep learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The model is built on the EfficientNetB1 architecture, which is known for its efficiency and performance on image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation includes chest X-ray images labeled as COVID-19 positive, pneumonia, and normal. The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle's COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database).
